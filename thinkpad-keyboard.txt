looks like 33 gpio required (two/three performing as a ps2 bus)

22 pins per side
2 sides

44 pins

socket on motherboard:
    height from board to top of socket - 1.40mm
    length - 14.97mm
    width at end flange - 5.99mm
    width at plastic inwards of flange - 3.92mm

    20 pins per side, plus what looks like NC retaining strap

plug on keyboard:

    22 pins per side, first and last look like retaining strap, but one of
    them have signals apparently connected.

H8S/2161BV Pin Assignments
; 32..25 PE  -> keyboard scan matrix outputs
; 50..43 PF  -> keyboard scan matrix outputs
; 58..51 PG  <- keyboard scan matrix inputs
;    108 P13 -> BJT -> ThinkLight LED
;      3 P44 -> BJT -> IGFET -> fan motor
;     80 P62 <- BJT <- fan tachometer signal

The keyboard is wired as a 16x8 matrix with port G as input and ports E
and F setting one pin at a time as output during a scan. A table is used
to then assign each key its "standard" PS/2 key location number. Fn,
Power, TrackPoint and touch pad buttons are not part of this matrix
but Access, Volume-, Volume+ and Mute keys are. And Caps Lock is also
(first thing to change to something more useful).
